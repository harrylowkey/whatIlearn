# Pillar 2: Security

- Protect information, systems, assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Design Principles:
  - Implement a strong identity foundation: Principle of least privilege - IAM
  - Enable tracebilitity: Integrate logs and metrics with systemcs to automatically respond and take action
  - Apply security at all layers: Edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer
  - Automate security best practices
  - Protect data in transit and at rest
  - Keep people away from data: Reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data
  - Prepare for security events: Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed
    for detection, investiation and recovery

Examples:

1.  Identity and Access Management
    - IAM, AWS-STS, MFA token, AWS Organizations
2.  Detective Controls
    - Config, CloudTrail, CloudWatch
3.  Infra Protection
    - Amazon CloudFront, VPC, Shield, WAF, Inspector
4.  Data Protection
    - KMS, S3, ELB, EBS, RDS
5.  Incident Response
    - IAM, CloudFormation, CloudWatch Events
