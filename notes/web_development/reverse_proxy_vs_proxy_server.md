A reverse proxy and a regular proxy (sometimes referred to as a forward proxy) serve similar purposes but operate in opposite directions. Here's a breakdown of each:

1. **Proxy Server**:
   - A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client (such as a web browser) and a destination server (such as a website).
   - When a client makes a request, it is sent to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the client.
   - The response from the destination server is then sent back to the proxy server, which in turn sends it back to the client.
   - Proxies are often used for various purposes such as caching content, improving security by filtering requests, bypassing geographical restrictions, or anonymizing traffic.

2. **Reverse Proxy**:
   - A reverse proxy, on the other hand, sits between the internet and a server (or servers) within an organization's network.
   - When a client makes a request, it is sent to the reverse proxy, which then forwards the request to the appropriate server.
   - The response from the server is then sent back to the reverse proxy, which forwards it to the client.
   - Reverse proxies are commonly used to enhance security, improve performance, and achieve better scalability.
   - They can also be used for load balancing, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.

**Key Differences**:

1. **Direction of Communication**:
   - Regular proxy: Communicates between client and destination server.
   - Reverse proxy: Communicates between client and one or more servers.

2. **Placement**:
   - Regular proxy: Typically used by clients to access resources outside of their network.
   - Reverse proxy: Placed in front of servers to handle incoming client requests.

3. **Purpose**:
   - Regular proxy: Often used for client-side tasks like caching, filtering, or anonymity.
   - Reverse proxy: Primarily used for server-side tasks like load balancing, security, and performance optimization.

In summary, while both types of proxies act as intermediaries, a regular proxy facilitates client requests to external servers, whereas a reverse proxy manages incoming client requests to internal servers.
