# Pillar 5: Cost Optimization

- Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

- Design Principles:
  - Adopt a consumption mode: Pay only for what you use
  - Measure overall efficiency: Use CloudWatch
  - Stop spending money on data center operations: AWS does the infra part and enables customer to focus on organization projects
  - Analyze and attribute expenditure: Accurate identification of system useage and costs, helps measure return on investment (ROI): Make sure category things using tags
  - Use managed and applciation level services to reduce cost of ownership: As managed services operate at cloud scale, they can offer a lower cost per transaction or service
