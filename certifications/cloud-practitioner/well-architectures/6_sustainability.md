# Pillar 6: Sustainability

- Focus on minimizing the environment impacts of running cloud workloads

- Design Principles:
  - Understand your impact: establish performnace indicators, evalute improvements
  - Establish sustainability goals: Set long-term goals for each workload, model return on investment (ROI)
  - Maximize utilization: Right size each workload to maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware and minimize idle resources
  - Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
  - Use managed services: Shared services reduce the amount of infra;
    Managed services help automate sustainability best practices as moving infrequent accessed data to cold storate and adjusting compute capacity
  - Reduce the downstream impact of you cloud workloads
